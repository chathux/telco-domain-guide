# Mobile Telecommunication Generations

G stands for generation. While you connected to internet, the speed of your internet is depends upon the signal strength that has been shown in alphabets like 2G, 3G, 4G etc. Each Generation is defined as a set of telephone network standards , which detail the technological implementation of a particular mobile phone system. The speed increases and the technology used to achieve that speed also changes. For eg, 1G offers 2.4 kbps, 2G offers 64 Kbps and is based on GSM, 3G offers 144 kbps-2 mbps whereas 4G offers 100 Mbps - 1 Gbps and is based on LTE technology .

The aim of wireless communication is to provide high quality, reliable communication just like wired communication(optical fibre) and each new generation of services represents a big step(a leap rather) in that direction. 

Each of the Generations has standards that must be met to officially use the G terminology. There are institutions in charge of standardizing each generation of mobile technology. Each generation has requirements that specify things like throughput, delay, etc. that need to be met to be considered part of that generation. Each generation built upon the research and development which happened since the last generation. 

1G was not used to identify wireless technology until 2G, or the second generation, was released. That was a major jump in the technology when the wireless networks went from analog to digital.The radio signals on 1G networks are analog, radio signals on 2G networks are digital.


# 1G 

This was the first generation of cell phone technology. These are the analog telecommunications standards that were introduced in the 1980s and continued until being replaced by 2G digital telecommunications. The maximum speed of 1G is 2.4 Kbps

# 2G

Main difference between 1G and 2G is that the 1G uses analog radio signals while 2G is digital. 2G capabilities are achieved by allowing multiple users on a single channel via multiplexing. During 2G Cellular phones are used for data also along with voice. The advance in technology from 1G to 2G introduced many of the fundamental services that we still use today, such as SMS, internal roaming , conference calls, call hold and billing based on services e.g. charges based on long distance calls and real time billing.

The follwing technologies were introduced in 2G.

- GSM - Global System for Mobile Communications
- CDMA - Code Division Multiple access
- GPRS - General Packet Radio Service
- EDGE - Enhanced GPRS  

GSM is a digital circuit switched networking technology for full duplex voice telephony. One obvious difference between GSM and CDMA devices were with regards to the SIM card. GSM handsets came with a SIM card slot, while CDMA phones did not. In other words, CDMA is a **handset-based standard**, with a phone number linked to a particular device.

GSM was later enhanced with **circuit switched transport** for data communications. it was further improved with **packet data transport** for internet applications and referred to as GPRS.

EDGE is significantly faster with a download speed and sometimes called a 2.5G network as it also has some characteristics of a 3G network.

The max speed of 2G with General Packet Radio Service ( GPRS ) is 50 Kbps or 1 Mbps with Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution ( EDGE ). Before making the major leap from 2G to 3G wireless networks, the lesser-known 2.5G and 2.75G was an interim standard that bridged the gap.

## 3G

Web browsing, email, video downloading, picture sharing and other Smartphone technology were introduced in the third generation. Introduced commercially in 2001. The goals set out for third generation mobile communication were to facilitate greater voice and data capacity, support a wider range of applications, and increase data transmission at a lower cost.

The 3G standard utilises a new technology called **UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System)** as its core network architecture. This network combines aspects of the 2G network with some new technology and protocols to deliver a significantly faster data rate.

`UMTS is a complete network system. As such, it also covers the radio access network, the core network, and the authentication of users using the USIM cards (or Subscriber Identity Module).` UMTS requires the use of new base stations, as well as new frequency allocations.

3G technologies.
- HSDPA - High-Speed Downlink Packet Access
- HSUPA - High-Speed Uplink Packet Access
- HSPA - High Speed Packet Access
- HSPA+ - Evolved High Speed Packet Access

High Speed Downlink Packet Access, or HSDPA, is a packet based data service feature of the WCDMA standard which provides a downlink with data transmission up to 8-10 Mbps.HSDPA is a technology upgrade to UMTS networks.

HSPA is a combination of HSDPA and HSUPA. HSPA+ is a hybrid 3G network that bridges the divide between 3G and 4G speeds. Some commercial network vendors have mistakenly labeled HSPA+ as being fully 4G, but this is misleading


Like 2G, 3G evolved into 3.5G and 3.75G as more features were introduced in order to bring about 4G. `A 3G phone cannot communicate through a 4G network` , but newer generations of phones are practically always designed to be backward compatible, so a 4G phone can communicate through a 3G or even 2G network.

## 4G

4G is a very different technology as compared to 3G and was made possible practically only because of the advancements in the technology in the last 10 years. Its purpose is to provide high speed , high quality and high capacity to users while improving security and lower the cost of voice and data services. The key technologies that have made this possible are **MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output)** and **OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)**. 

4G does not make use of circuit switching. Instead, it operates using an all-Internet Protocol (IP) based communication. This includes Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). While 4G and 3G have a lot in common, the former completely dumps the spread spectrum radio technology used by the latter.

The two important 4G standards are **WiMAX** (has now fizzled out) and **LTE** (has seen widespread deployment). LTE (Long Term Evolution) is a series of upgrades to existing UMTS technology.

LTE is the stepping stone or bridge that connects 3G and 4G. Think of it as an upgrade to 3G but not exactly on the same level as 4G.

Before true 4G was achieved, the standards set by the ITU-R were largely deemed unattainable. In fact, a number of tech companies spent a lot of time and money to reach the requirements but failed to do so. For this reason, when LTE was introduced, the ITU-R allowed it to be called 4G despite not meeting its standards. The way they saw it was, as long as it was significantly better and more advanced than 3G, it could take on the name of 4G.

As a result of the ITU-R lowering the bar for what could be marketed as 4G, service providers jumped at the chance to offer LTE as “4G LTE.” This is why, for a long time, people confused the two as being one and the same. And, if you think you have experienced 4G, you may be wrong. Just because your mobile phone displays a “4G” symbol on the top corner of your screen does not mean that it is true 4G. In fact, it could just be 4G LTE.

To take full advantage of 4G, you will need a smartphone or tablet with full 4G support (not just LTE)


`The max speed of a 4G network when the device is moving is 100 Mbps or 1 Gbps for low mobility communication like when stationary or walking.`
